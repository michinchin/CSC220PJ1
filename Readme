CSC220 Programming Project#1
============================
 
Due Date: 11:55pm, Sunday, 10/16, upload textfile MyFraction.java to ilearn

- You need to implement MyFraction class which is within package PJ1
  See PJ1/MyFraction.java and PJ1/MyFractionInterface.java for specifications

- Use PJ1_Test.java to test correctness of your proggram

- Compile programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):
	
  javac PJ1/*.java
  javac PJ1_Test.java

- Run programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):

  // Run tests in MyFraction class
  java PJ1.MyFraction	

  // Run main test program
  java PJ1_Test		

- Bonus (25%): Implement GUI test program
  
  Before implemeting GUI test program, 
  your program must work for all test cases using PJ1_Test.
